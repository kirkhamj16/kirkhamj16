Hi! My name is Jake Kirkham, I am a recent grad from Princeton, majoring in Computer Science. I am [currently interested in software engineering jobs](JakeKirkhamResume21.pdf); my prior experience focuses on Computer Graphics, Distributed Systems, and Computer Architecture, but I am excited and open to a variety of areas!

My most recent project was the development of a GPU memory model testing tool that found new, previously unknown compiler bugs in Intel GPU software. You can check out my [research paper](oopsla2020.pdf) based on the project attached below, published originally at OOPSLA20. In addition, I've worked on Computer Graphics projects (see my COS 426 repo for competition projects, or my 426 catcher repo for my final project), worked as a TA for Princeton's upper-level distributed systems course, and worked on several smaller independent projects.

You can reach me with any questions or opportunities at jacob.a.kirkham@gmail.com.
